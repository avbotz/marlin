# Wiimote Control of Marlin

### Installation

Make sure you have bluez installed.

Download and compile the *wiiuse* library at https://github.com/rpavlik/wiiuse.

Move libwiiuse.so to ./3rdparty/

Then `make bin/wiimote` and it should be all set up.

### Usage

Run it to run it in sim. There should be another bash script to test on the sub as soon as we get around to that.
